Features
--------
The CAPTAIN Toolbox is a collection of MATLAB functions for non-stationary time series analysis, forecasting and control. The toolbox is useful for system identification, signal extraction, interpolation, backcasting, forecasting, data-based mechanistic modelling and control of a wide range of linear and non-linear stochastic systems. It consists of three modules: TVPMOD for time variable parameter stochastic models, RIVSID for Transfer Function identification, and TDCONT for multivariable control system design.
