MATLAB toolbox for system identification, time series analysis, forecasting and control.

CAPTAIN was originated by Professor Peter C. Young five decades ago. The MATLAB version has been in continuous use by researchers in academia and industry for over 25 years and continues to be developed. Since October 2024, it has been available via File Exchange. The authors hope that the latest algorithms in the toolbox will allow interested researchers to add to the ever-expanding list of successful applications, which already includes the analysis of numerous engineering, environmental, biological, medical and socio-economic processes.

Features
--------
The CAPTAIN Toolbox is useful for system identification, signal extraction, interpolation, backcasting, forecasting, data-based mechanistic modelling and control of a wide range of linear and non-linear stochastic systems. It consists of three modules: TVPMOD for time variable parameter stochastic models, RIVSID for Transfer Function identification, and TDCONT for multivariable control system design.

Installation
------------
The attached MATLAB toolbox .mltbx file, includes m-files, p-code, data, documentation and Simulink models. To install, one option is to open the saved file from within MATLAB (i.e. Home>Open). Alternatively, use the MATLAB Add-Ons interface to install from File Exchange.
