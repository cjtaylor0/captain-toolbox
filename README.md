# CAPTAIN Toolbox
 
MATLAB Toolbox for System Identification, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control. The CAPTAIN Toolbox was originated by Professor Peter C. Young and is used to generate the results in his books. Visit our web site for more information, including to download Guides that fully define the mathematical models with worked examples:

Features
--------
The CAPTAIN Toolbox is useful for system identification, signal extraction, interpolation, backcasting, forecasting, data-based mechanistic modelling and control of a wide range of linear and non-linear stochastic systems. It consists of three modules: TVPMOD for time variable parameter stochastic models, RIVSID for Transfer Function identification, and TDCONT for multivariable control system design.

Installation
------------
The attached MATLAB toolbox .mltbx file, includes m-files, p-code, data, documentation and Simulink models. To install, one option is to open the saved file from within MATLAB (i.e. Home>Open). Alternatively, use the MATLAB Add-Ons interface to install from File Exchange.
