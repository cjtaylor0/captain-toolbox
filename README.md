# CAPTAIN Toolbox for System Identification, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control

MATLAB functions for non-stationary time series analysis, forecasting and control. Visit our web site for more information, including to download Guides that fully define the mathematical models with worked examples:

Features
--------
The toolbox is useful for system identification, signal extraction, interpolation, backcasting, forecasting, data-based mechanistic modelling and control of a wide range of linear and non-linear stochastic systems. It consists of three modules: TVPMOD for time variable parameter stochastic models, RIVSID for Transfer Function identification, and TDCONT for multivariable control system design.

Installation
------------
If you download the attached file, such as captain.mltbx, then open this from within MATLAB (i.e. Home>Open) to install. Alternatively, use the MATLAB Add-Ons interface to find and install the toolbox.
